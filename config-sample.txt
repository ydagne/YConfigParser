# A simple configuration file
  # With multiple lines of comments
    # indented with spaces of variable length

# including empty lines

     
# The configuration format is hierarchical where every
# sub-field is preceeded with indentation white-space.
# All sub-fields belonging to the same parent should have
# equal indentation. Every parameter-value pair is separated
# with a colon. A field might not be followed by a value after
# the colon, in which case sub-fields are expected to exist.
# Moreover, a field might have a value and one or more sub-fields.

# Note:
#       - Parameters names can be made up of multiple words separated
#         by white spaces.
#       - Indentations can be with white spaces or TABs. TABS between
#         white spaces (or vice versa) are not allowed.
#       - Every TAB in indentations is counted as one white space.

# The following are list of supported field types:
#
#    Type           Example                 Remarks
#   ------------------------------------------------------------
#    boolean        TRUE                   TRUE/FALSE in UPPER CASE
#    int            134245
#    float          15.2453
#    string         "hello world"          in double quotes
#
# In addition to the above basic types, values can be arrays enclosed
# in squre brackets ([...]) in which case subsequent entries are separated
# by a comma (,).
